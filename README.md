# About
The task was to create a program that solves the **Josephus Problem** with functional programming and with as many **pure functions**  as possible without using the methods of Array.prototype and classes.

The file josephus_problem.js contains more pure functions compared to main.js because I used a library for drawing in main.js.

## Disclaimer / Credits
The css file and the path animation (main.js:function"animateElementRemoval()") were partially produces with the help of chatgpt, the rest of the code was written by me alone.

They can only be  considered additional visual elements and not part of the main task. 

Why did I use it for these optional parts?  It helped understanding the different css commands and helped me find the correct methods from the svgdotjs library.
